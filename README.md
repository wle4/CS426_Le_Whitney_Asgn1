# CS426_Le_Whitney_Asgn1

You play the game as BB8 wandering through the city BB8 lives in. However... You have to destroy it! Even if it's BB8's hometown, it's been infected with a lot of hazardous chemicals so it might be destructed. Go around blowing up the infected buildings with a cannon, and make sure the entire city is cleared! The camera is third person on BB8 and follows him as he moves. The decorations include the buildings and the cannon. There are lights in the gas station. There are wall boundaries you cannot get out of, buildings, and BB8 has a cannon with cannonballs that can shoot more than 5 cannonballs. BB8 cannot fall through the ground and when BB8 shoots cannonballs, he does not slide around etc. There is gravity to the cannonballs. The walls keep BB8 and the cannonballs inside. The targets are the buildings. There is a scoreboard and everytime a cannonball hits a building, the scoreboard is incremented. Three 3D objects include the buildings, BB8, and the cannon. Three 2D textures include the scoreboard, the title of the game, and textures on the buildings.
