# CS426_Le_Whitney_Asgn1

You play as BB-8, wandering through the city where BB-8 lives. However... you have to destroy it! Even though it's BB-8's hometown, it has been contaminated with hazardous chemicals and must be demolished. Go around blasting the infected buildings with a cannon, and make sure the entire city is cleared!
